We found that our Data Team was approximately 15-20x faster with the ML-derived overlay for Pakistan, Nigeria, and Zambia (Figure XXX). The total time spent mapping and validating each country (once ML predictions were available) is in Table 1.

  <figcaption><b>Figure XXX. Mapping rate with and without ML-assist. On average, km^2 per hour increased by Xx, towers per hour by Xx, and substations per hour by Xx. Note that these figures exclude hours spent validating (i.e., double-checking) added edits. This ensured a fair comparison as no validation was carried out during the pre-ML mapping work. </b></figcaption>

Table 1. **Total person-hours spent mapping at country-wide scale.**

| Country  | Hours mapping | Hours validating |
| -------- |:-------------:|:----------------:|
| Pakistan | 364.13		   | 181.09 |
| Nigeria  | -             | - |
| Zambia   | -             | - |
