Access to electricity is still limited in many developing nations. A variety of factors underlie this problem, but one key issue is holding back progress: a map of the high-voltage (HV) infrastructure rarely exists. And the schematics that are available are often outdated, incomplete, or split between a number of different agencies. Without a centralized map, governments or other organizations do not have the knowledge to make informed decisions on where to invest in maintenance or expansion of the electric grid. Interestingly, this lack of information also complicates decisions about alternative energy sources — without knowing where the conventional grid exists, it’s hard to intelligently deploy alternatives like solar- or wind-power ([Szabó et al., 2011](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034002)). Beyond just the map itself, governments and organizations need an fast and cost-effective mapping pipeline. Like all infrastructure, the HV grid is always in flux, so the ability to create an accurate snapshot at regular intervals is an important goal. Toward this goal, we partnered with the World Bank to develop a pipeline capable of efficiently mapping HV infrastructure at a country-wide scale.
