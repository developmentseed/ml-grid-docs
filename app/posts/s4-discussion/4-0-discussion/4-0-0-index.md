We created a workflow to boost human mapping speed by 15-20x when tracing high-voltage infrastructure. At a high level, we used machine learning to find satellite imagery tiles that were most likely to contain HV towers and then pass this information to our Data Team -- a group of professional mappers -- to trace the HV infrastructure. This strategy was testing in three countries: Pakistan, Nigeria, and Zambia comprised of a total land area of XXX km2. The rest of this discussion is focused first on the advantages of this strategy, and then improvements for future iterations of this mapping workflow; namely, how to better handle massive datasets, improve the machine learning predictions, and better incorporate these predictions into human mapping workflow.
